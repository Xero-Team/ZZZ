title: Use Claude Agent, Gemini CLI, and Codex in ZZZ
description: Run Claude Agent, Gemini CLI, Codex, and other AI coding agents directly in ZZZ via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
---

# External Agents

ZZZ supports CLI-based external agents through the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com).

Supported examples include [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Claude Agent](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot-language-server-release), and [additional agents](#add-more-agents) you can configure.

ZZZ ships ACP only. There is no built-in native agent. See
[Agent Tools](./tools.md) for tool permission rows that still apply to
external agents.

> **Note:** External agents are separate processes. Authentication, billing, terms, and data handling are between you and that agent provider.

## Gemini CLI {#gemini-cli}

ZZZ can run [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) directly in the [agent panel](./agent-panel.md).
Under the hood we run Gemini CLI in the background, and talk to it over ACP.

### Getting Started

First open the agent panel with {#kb agent::ToggleFocus}, and then use the `+` button in the top right to start a new Gemini CLI thread.

If you'd like to bind this to a keyboard shortcut, you can do so by editing your `keymap.json` file via the `zzz: open keymap file` command to include:

```json [keymap]
[
  {
    "bindings": {
      "cmd-alt-g": [
        "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",
        { "agent": { "custom": { "name": "gemini" } } }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Installation

Install the Gemini CLI executable yourself, or use the Agent Registry
**Install** button. Opening a thread does not download or install an agent.

#### Authentication

After you have Gemini CLI running, you'll be prompted to authenticate.

Click the "Login" button to open the Gemini CLI interactively, where you can log in with your Google account or [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) credentials.
ZZZ does not see your OAuth or access tokens in this case.

If the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable (or `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`) is already set, or you have configured a Google AI API key in ZZZ's [language model provider settings](./llm-providers.md#google-ai), it will be passed to Gemini CLI automatically.

For more information, see the [Gemini CLI docs](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/index.md).

### Usage

Gemini CLI supports code generation, refactoring, debugging, and Q&A. Add context by @-mentioning files, recent threads, or symbols.

> Some agent panel features are not yet available with Gemini CLI: editing past messages, resuming threads from history, and checkpointing.

## Claude Agent

Similar to Gemini CLI, you can also run [Claude Agent](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) directly via ZZZ's [agent panel](./agent-panel.md).
Under the hood, ZZZ runs the Claude Agent SDK, which runs Claude Code under the hood, and communicates to it over ACP, through [a dedicated adapter](https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-agent-acp).

### Getting Started

Open the agent panel with {#kb agent::ToggleFocus}, and then use the `+` button in the top right to start a new Claude Agent thread.

If you'd like to bind this to a keyboard shortcut, you can do so by editing your `keymap.json` file via the `zzz: open keymap file` command to include:

```json [keymap]
[
  {
    "bindings": {
      "cmd-alt-c": [
        "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",
        { "agent": { "custom": { "name": "claude-acp" } } }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Authentication

Authentication to ZZZ's Claude Agent installation is decoupled from ZZZ's built-in agent.
That is to say, an Anthropic API key added via the built-in agent settings will _not_ be utilized by Claude Agent for authentication and billing.

Claude or ChatGPT login belongs to the external agent, not to ZZZ.
[Open a new Claude Agent thread](./agent-panel.md#new-thread), then run
`/login` in that agent if it asks you to authenticate. Use an API key or
the agent's own subscription login. ZZZ does not create or bill that
account.

#### Installation

Install the Claude Agent ACP adapter yourself, or use the Agent Registry
**Install** button. Opening a thread does not download or install
`claude-agent-acp` or `codex-acp`.

If you want to override the executable used by the adapter, you can set the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` environment variable in your settings to the path of your preferred executable.

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "claude-acp": {
      "type": "registry",
      "env": {
        "CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE": "/path/to/alternate-claude-code-executable"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

Claude Agent supports code generation, refactoring, debugging, and Q&A. Add context by @-mentioning files, recent threads, diagnostics, or symbols.

In complement to talking to it [over ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com), ZZZ relies on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) to support some of its specific features.
However, the SDK doesn't yet expose everything needed to fully support all of them:

- Slash Commands: [Custom slash commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) are fully supported, and have been merged into skills. A subset of [built-in commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#built-in-slash-commands) are supported.
- [Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) are supported.
- [Agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) are currently _not_ supported.
- [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) are currently _not_ supported.

> Some [agent panel](./agent-panel.md) features are not yet available with Claude Agent: editing past messages, resuming threads from history, and checkpointing.

#### CLAUDE.md

Claude Agent in ZZZ will automatically use any `CLAUDE.md` file found in your project root, project subdirectories, or root `.claude` directory.

If you don't have a `CLAUDE.md` file, you can ask Claude Agent to create one for you through the `init` slash command.

## Codex CLI

You can also run [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) directly via ZZZ's [agent panel](./agent-panel.md).
Under the hood, ZZZ runs Codex CLI and communicates to it over ACP, through [a dedicated adapter](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp).

### Getting Started

As of version `0.208`, you should be able to use Codex directly from ZZZ.
Open the agent panel with {#kb agent::ToggleFocus}, and then use the `+` button in the top right to start a new Codex thread.

If you'd like to bind this to a keyboard shortcut, you can do so by editing your `keymap.json` file via the `zzz: open keymap file` command to include:

```json
[
  {
    "bindings": {
      "cmd-alt-c": [
        "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",
        { "agent": { "custom": { "name": "codex-acp" } } }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Authentication

Authentication to ZZZ's Codex installation is decoupled from ZZZ's built-in agent.
That is to say, an OpenAI API key added via the built-in agent settings will _not_ be utilized by Codex for authentication and billing.

To ensure you're using your billing method of choice, [open a new Codex thread](./agent-panel.md#new-thread).
The first time you will be prompted to authenticate with one of three methods:

1. Login with ChatGPT - allows you to use your existing, paid ChatGPT subscription. _Note: This method isn't currently supported in remote projects_
2. `CODEX_API_KEY` - uses an API key you have set in your environment under the variable `CODEX_API_KEY`.
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - uses an API key you have set in your environment under the variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

If you are already logged in and want to change your authentication method, type `/logout` in the thread and authenticate again.

If you want to use a third-party provider with Codex, you can configure that with your [Codex config.toml](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md#model-selection) or pass extra [args/env variables](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md#model-selection) to your Codex agent servers settings.

#### Installation

Install `codex-acp` yourself, or use the Agent Registry **Install**
button. Opening a thread does not download or install Codex.

### Usage

Codex supports code generation, refactoring, debugging, and Q&A. Add context by @-mentioning files or symbols.

> Some agent panel features are not yet available with Codex: editing past messages, resuming threads from history, and checkpointing.

## Add More Agents {#add-more-agents}

### Via The ACP Registry

#### Overview

[The ACP Registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry) lets developers distribute ACP-compatible agents to any client that implements the protocol. Agents installed from the registry update automatically.

At the moment, the registry is a curated set of agents, including only the ones that [support authentication](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/auth-methods).

#### Using it in ZZZ

Use the `zzz: acp registry` command to quickly go to the ACP Registry page.
There's also a button ("Add Agent") that takes you there in the agent panel's configuration view.

From there, you can click to install your preferred agent and it will become available right away in the `+` icon button in the agent panel.

### Custom Agents

You can also add agents through your settings file ([how to edit](../configuring-zed.md#settings-files)) by specifying certain fields under `agent_servers`, like so:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "My Custom Agent": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/projects/agent/index.js", "--acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

This can be useful if you're in the middle of developing a new agent that speaks the protocol and you want to debug it.

It's also possible to customize environment variables for registry-installed agents like Claude Agent, Codex, and Gemini CLI by using their registry names (`claude-acp`, `codex-acp`, `gemini`) with `"type": "registry"` in your settings.

### OpenCode {#opencode}

The public ACP registry still lists OpenCode 1.x GitHub release
archives. Those GitHub v1 assets are stale: OpenCode v2 is not
published as a GitHub Release, and the ACP command remains
`opencode acp`. ZZZ rewrites registry-installed OpenCode 1.x entries
to the latest v2 binaries from `https://opencode.ai/files/bin/`
before download.

To use an OpenCode binary you already have, add a custom agent:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "opencode": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "opencode",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging Agents

When using external agents in ZZZ, you can access the debug view with `dev: open acp logs` from the Command Palette.
This lets you see the messages being sent and received between ZZZ and the agent.

ACP logs are available in the local debug view.

It's helpful to attach data from this view if you're opening issues about
problems with external agents.

## Configuration Boundaries {#configuration-boundaries}

External agents run as separate processes that communicate with ZZZ via the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com). This creates important boundaries between ZZZ's configuration and the agent's native configuration.

### What ZZZ Forwards to External Agents

When you start an external agent thread, ZZZ sends:

| Setting               | How to Configure                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model selection       | `agent_servers.<agent>.default_model` in settings                     |
| Mode selection        | `agent_servers.<agent>.default_mode` in settings                      |
| Environment variables | `agent_servers.<agent>.env` in settings                               |
| MCP servers           | `context_servers` in settings (see [limitations](#mcp-server-access)) |
| Working directory     | Automatically set to project root                                     |

**Not forwarded:**

- [Profiles](./agent-panel.md#profiles) — profiles only apply to ZZZ's built-in agent
- [Tool permissions](./tool-permissions.md) settings — external agents request permissions at runtime via UI prompts
- Rules files — ZZZ's [rules system](./rules.md) only applies to ZZZ's built-in agent (external agents read their own rules files directly)

### What External Agents Read Directly {#native-config}

External agents run as CLI tools with full filesystem access. They read their own configuration files directly — ZZZ doesn't forward or block these.

#### Claude Agent

Claude Agent runs Claude Code under the hood, which reads its standard configuration:

| Config                              | Read by Claude Agent?                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/` directory              | Yes — Claude Code reads its own settings and memory               |
| CLAUDE.md files                     | Yes — Claude Code reads these directly from the project           |
| Skills                              | Yes — exposed via the Claude Agent SDK                            |
| MCP servers from Claude Code config | Yes — but ZZZ also forwards its own MCP servers via ACP           |
| Hooks                               | No — [not supported](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) |
| Authentication                      | Separate — you must authenticate via `/login` in ZZZ              |

> **Why separate authentication?** ZZZ isolates Claude Agent authentication to give you control over which account and billing method you use.

#### Codex

Codex runs the Codex CLI under the hood, which reads its standard configuration:

| Config                        | Read by Codex?                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.codex/config.toml`        | Yes — Codex CLI reads its own config            |
| MCP servers from Codex config | Yes — but ZZZ also forwards its own MCP servers |
| `CODEX_API_KEY` env var       | Yes — inherited from your shell environment     |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var      | Yes — inherited from your shell environment     |
| ChatGPT OAuth login           | Separate — you must re-authenticate in ZZZ      |

You can also pass environment variables through ZZZ settings:

```json [settings]
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "codex-acp": {
      "type": "registry",
      "env": {
        "CODEX_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "CUSTOM_PROVIDER_URL": "https://..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Server Access {#mcp-server-access}

MCP servers configured in ZZZ's `context_servers` are forwarded to Claude Agent and Codex via the ACP protocol.

- **Local stdio-based MCP servers:** Work reliably
- **Remote MCP servers with OAuth:** May have issues; prefer local stdio-based servers when possible.

External agents can access MCP servers from two sources: ZZZ's `context_servers` (forwarded via ACP) and their own native configuration files (`~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/config.toml`).

For more on configuring MCP servers, see [Model Context Protocol](./mcp.md).

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

**"I enabled MCP tools in ZZZ but the agent can't see them"**

1. Verify the MCP server is enabled in `context_servers` settings
2. For remote MCP servers with OAuth, try local stdio-based servers instead.
3. Open `dev: open acp logs` from the Command Palette to debug

**"My existing Claude Code / Codex setup isn't working in ZZZ"**

External agents read their own config files, but authentication is handled separately:

1. Re-authenticate via `/login` (Claude Agent) or the authentication prompt (Codex)
2. Your existing MCP servers and settings from `~/.claude/` or `~/.codex/config.toml` should work
3. You can also configure additional settings via `agent_servers.<agent>.env` in ZZZ

**"Profiles don't affect my external agent"**

Correct — [profiles](./agent-panel.md#profiles) only apply to ZZZ's built-in agent. External agents have their own tool sets and don't use ZZZ's profile system.
